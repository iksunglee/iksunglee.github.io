New to Crytocurrency but feeling good
---------------------------
Just recently started trading Ether for the past few days but today was different.
It's just that i sold too early, didn't trust my instincts that this could comeback up again.
Tried to find the pattern of the wave but right now, thinking of a way to start. I just hope things goes well soon.
