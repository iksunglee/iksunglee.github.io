My trip to San Francisco and what I learned:
============================================

Generally I didn't actually look forward in the learning process. I did not know what to expect from the trip but later realized that there are a lot of things to study around the world. So let me share some of them.

Every system maybe reused for other niche markets

> This was when we were visiting a church in Berkeley and had lunch there. There were at lot of people who look all normal blue collar workers but in reality they have so much more to share than you expected. One interesting person I met was a founder named Nate who has successfully sold 2 companies despite the recession and other problems every founder might have exprienced during his time which caught my curiosity and asked "what is your secret to such success?" then he answered this simple line that "every [software] system maybe repurposed for other profitable markets so try to learn the system as deeply as possible to understand it's other applications."
> For some of you readers, this maybe a obvious suggestion while you are reading this but when you think about it isn't that obvious when you are stuck doing the same work over and over again that you reach a point that you don't think about what you are doing. But this can end well, Study the system and understand why it is so effective and think about ways on how this boring thing could be updated to something new.

Small steps at a time... Really small steps
