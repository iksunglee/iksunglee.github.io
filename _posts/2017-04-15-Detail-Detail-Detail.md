Time in and time out, I have found out I do miss some of the things I've should have learned in front of eyes.
I guess the concept of subjective concentration where you only see that humans(at least me) choose to forget things may it be intentionally or not.

So this story comes for this story:

I was currently lost in the process of understanding Embedded systems and coding it. 
But then I felt that I have never learned this before, throwing me off into a state of panic.
With the feeling, I fractically search the net for some answers but sadly I was left with only with weird non_related answers.

Then a few weeks have passed,

and before I know it, it was a week before exam week. then when I search through my old notes
then found the answer that I was finding for the past few weeks.
The letters of that specific page mocking for my newly discovered stupidity and shouting "I am right here you idiot!"
But like an old friend. I replied with smile. Feeling relieved that there is hope for everything.

Lesson of the day: it's helpful to look back on your notes sometime to know what you actually studied. Seriously.
