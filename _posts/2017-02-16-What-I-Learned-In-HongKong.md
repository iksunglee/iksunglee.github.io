It took time to actually organize everything. Too much information to crunch into one blog entry so I will write this in succinct manner in bullet points.
So here goes.

Adam Smith would be very proud and interested in Hong Kong existence today

No tax, Laws that require competitors (at least two) to stick together whenever they open a branch, Banks printing their own notes and
constantly changing shops on the first floor. This all are the effect of a free economy policy that Hong Kong's governement have been implementing for years.
As a result of this effect, according to my oberservation everyone was willing to do something in exchange for some cash. Beggars are not begging on the street but singing.
Foriegn traveller who need money sell their pictures or handmade products to earn a couple of bucks to continue their adventure. Everything living thing was either walking fast or selling something in return of survival.
