title: "My trip to San Francisco and what I learned:"

Generally I didn't actually look forward in the learning process. I did not know what to expect from the trip but later realized that there are a lot of things to study around the world. So let me share some of them.

Every system maybe reused for other niche markets 
--------------------------------------------------

> This was when we were visiting a church in Berkeley and had lunch there. There were at lot of people who look all normal blue collar workers but in reality they have so much more to share than you expected. One interesting person I met was a founder named Nate who has successfully sold 2 companies despite the recession and other problems every founder might have exprienced during his time which caught my curiosity and asked "what is your secret to such success?" then he answered this simple line that "every [software] system maybe repurposed for other profitable markets so try to learn the system as deeply as possible to understand it's other applications."
> For some of you readers, this maybe a obvious suggestion while you are reading this but when you think about it isn't that obvious when you are stuck doing the same work over and over again that you reach a point that you don't think about what you are doing. But this can end well, Study the system and understand why it is so effective and think about ways on how this boring thing could be updated to something new.

Small steps at a time... Really small steps
-------------------------------------------

> Block71, Singapore, and a cute smile. Fiona was an inspiration for this lesson. She is a cofounder of the Cookie company called **"Green Peas Cookie"**. These non-gluten based cookies is now a constant reminder that you need to keep moving forward but in small steps. Meeting people who you can meet do the things that you could do now. Don't try to over strech or else you'll get burnt out and end up giving up. It's about the process not the results, so keep your head high and move on forward. 
*quicknote if you are interested in cookies just follow this [link](https://www.greenpeacookie.com/)
it's really healthy and tasty as well~

Traveling with a purpose is the best way to move forward
--------------------------------------------------------

>This trip was a last minute trip to the US. It was almost canceled due to lack of funds but in the end the secretary was able to rake up the funds for different departments so that we could go. So thank you for that.

>So as a result of this last minute trip to the Silicon Valley, I have found out that we had to create our own schedules to get the best out of our trip there. This was a challenge to us but later we managed to find more interesting meetings that we have never imagined that could be possible. (or maybe it's just me) I personally think, planned or spontaneous we have the pro

>So how did we do it? We checked for meetups that is generally free or maybe cheap enough to help us learn something new in the span of 2~3 weeks. Also we had a link to the TechShop(SF) so that can learn something new from professional makers in the makerspace. (Popcorn and Hot Chocolates are good)

>In other words, our funds may have affected our way of approaching things but ironically due to lack of fund we were able to meet people who wasn't in our usual social circle of realm of possibilities which included a construction company CEO who also runs a coffee shop with his wife in the heart of San Francisco.
