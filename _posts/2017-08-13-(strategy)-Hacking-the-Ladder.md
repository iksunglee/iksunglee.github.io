Hacking the Ladder
------------------
	From this month, I want to challenge myself to hack the ladder. Before I go on to the specifics let me explain what “hacking the ladder” meant. Hacking the ladder is a termed that I learned through the book “Smart Hacks” by snow. It just means that you don't go through the traditional route that most people think is the “normal” way to do things. One example is the generally assumption that in order to be the president of the United States you have to go through the three branches of state and other insider activities to get the favor of the voters and fellow politicians but this was just an assumption made people study the pattern that have been going on for a couple of centuries. Take for instance president Obama who was still (enter age when he campaigned for Pres.) and didn't have to go through the long and difficult path to the presidency that people generally think of.

	So now with that said, let's talk about my current situation. I am a 26 year old human being in Korea. Small country with about (enter population) and naturally one of the most competitive societies in the world (similar to Hong Kong). How competitive you ask? An average high school kid (regardless of gender) studies about (insert time) and eventually goes to sleep at (insert time). Which gives an average of (total of hours) of sleep. All for the dream of going to a good college and a stable job (preferably, civil servant widely believed to be never fired unless you do something close of crime)
	
Now to evaluate my options and other alternatives that I currently have right now are the following:

1. Finish a courses that I am currently taking on-line and create side projects for future employers to see. (business reports preferably)
2. Write articles like this about what I learned or am interested in.
3. Create a marketing project to get noticed through social media. Like printing something for someone who has a following. (Instagram maybe, I got this idea from gray v)

So with all that said, I am hoping that I will soon find that one of these options would help me meet people who would be willing to help me grow my career ambition. 

I hope this 'hack' plan will be in motion soon and hopefully I could update you readers soon on the current ladder hack plan for the next six months.
