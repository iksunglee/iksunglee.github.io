Class started again today but this feels a bit different than the jumpstarts that have experienced so far. 
I was both scared on the idea of being judged by my past's low self-esteem and low quality assignements that I have sent to my professors in the past. But a funny thing happened today...

First Class, Embedded Applications (technically microprocessing course but the school needed the money for a government funded financial aid program thus the name) was a class I kind of dislike due to the difficulty of its test and other project that requires a lot of time and resources to get through a semester and actually pass the subject.

To be continued in the end of the day.
